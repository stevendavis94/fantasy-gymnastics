# fantasy-gymnastics
This is for the web application for drafting fantasy gymnastics.
Things that it will be able to do:
- Allow for selecting a drafting style (first-last, snake).
- Allow for dynamic selection of how many drafters there will be, with the names being entered and tracked.
- Be able to select the size of each team before the draft (number of rounds).
- Have a timer that if not picked by the end of the timer, there will be an auto-draft (details to be determined later).
- Keep track of drafted teams and remove those who are picked from the selectable athletes.
- At the end of draft, be able to download a CSV file for use in Excel for the matchups.
